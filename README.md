# Calendrum

Calendrum is a simple and highly customizable calendar view for neovim
implemented 100% with lua. The idea is to provide very similar functionality to
[calendar-vim](https://github.com/mattn/calendar-vim/) but in lua.

It is also my first plugin, therefore any help is appreciated.

TODO: continue README, it does not make sense to add much more since I've just
started developing it.

In order to preview the changes made, execute the following line within the
neovim console:

```
source ./lua/calendrum/init.lua
```
